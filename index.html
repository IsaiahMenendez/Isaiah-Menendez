        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Isaiah Menendez I am a seventeen-year-old undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside. I have been a part of a few organizations and clubs, such as the National Honors Society, Self-Defense Club, and Animal Friends of the Valley. He had also taken many college courses before attending UCR as a freshman. I am a first-generation university student. I look forward to being the first in my family to attain my degree. I have worked for a small photography business, which inspired me to pursue my degree in business and eventually create my own business. There are many goals that I want to achieve, but as of now, my primary goal is to do good during his time at UCR.
<br><br>

        I am currently taking a computer science class where I am learning to code for the first time. So far I have coded two websites, and am currently working on a third one. In this computer science class, I am coding using the coding language HTML. HTML is one of the more simpler coding languages to understand. In this computer science class, I have also learned how to use Microsoft programs such as Excel and Word. This class has helped me learn the basics of computers, which will allow me to work well in the corporate environment.
	Another class that will help me in the work environment is my macroeconomics class. This macroeconomics has shown me how the economy works. It allows me to understand the relationship between supply, demand, scarcity, and other factors that will affect the economy. The class allows me to be able to work with economic issues which would allow me to be very versatile in different work environments. 
	One of the other classes that I am taking is my physics class. My physics class gives me insight into how early philosophers came up with the laws of the universe. This class has been very helpful in increasing my physics background. If I were to continue taking science-related physics courses I would be able to have a stronger background for physics. This would allow me to be a very good candidate for a science-related job.
<br><br>

        I also have work experience. I have worked at my local grocery store where I learned great customer service skills. I was also able to use my understanding of economics while working to see how inflation affected the prices of products around me. I also saw how the economy changed and affected the wages of those around me. I gained a fifty-cent raise. This was because the government made it mandatory that business increase their minimum wages from fifteen dollars to fifteen dollars and fifty cents. The job that I had helped reinforce what I was learning in class and allowed me to apply it to real-world principles. I am looking forward to the next job available to me.
